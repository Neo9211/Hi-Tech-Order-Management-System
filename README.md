# Hi-Tech Order Management System
 The Hi-Tech Order Management System is a Windows application created by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, C#, and SQL Server 2017. This project manages a database with many-to-many relationships using ADO.NET, Entity Framework, and LINQ. The system controls Hi-business Tech's policies, including book records with ISBN s, titles, unit prices, years of publication, quantities in stock, and author and publisher details. Additionally, it allows order clerks to take customer orders via phone, fax, or email and controls customer information such as name, address, phone number, and credit limit. Direct bank account withdrawals from the consumer are used to pay for orders. Two order clerks who are in charge of taking customer orders are employed by the system. I used different classes on this project like GUI, data access etc.
